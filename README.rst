Pure lexer for pygments. Install with ``sudo python setup.py install``.

This adds a Pure lexer to pygments (http://pygments.org/) so that Pure source
files can be highlighted, cf. http://pygments.org/docs/plugins/. This comes in
handy, in particular, when formatting the Pure documentation at
https://agraef.github.io/pure-docs/.

Most of the boilerplate code to turn this into a separate plugin loadable by
pygments was gleaned from https://github.com/shkumagai/pygments-style-solarized.

Enjoy!
